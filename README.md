# ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Ben
---

I am a motivated web developer based in the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­. Currently I am working as a Jr. Fullstack developer using MERN Stack (MySql, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

Currently Iâ€™m exploring some technologies used for web development. My main tool for frontend development is React.js.

Outside of my work I love playing video games. At the moment, I am into story-driven video games. I also love cooking for my girlfriend and our adorable doggo named Nuggets.

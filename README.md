# 👋 Hi, I’m Ben

I am a motivated web developer based in the Philippines 🇵🇭. Currently I am working as a Jr. Fullstack developer using MERN Stack (MySql, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

Currently, I’m exploring some technologies used for web development. My main tool for frontend development is React.js.

Outside of my work I love playing video games. At the moment, I am into story-driven video games. I also love cooking for my girlfriend and our adorable doggo named Nuggets 👩🏽‍🦱🐶💖.

I am currently looking for another job opportunity right now. If you're looking for a web developer who can help you build or maintain a web-application please hit me up via [email, clyd.benidz@gmail.com](mailto:clyd.benidz@gmail.com).
